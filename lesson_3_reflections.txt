Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: When you want to keep a copy for yourself that you can easily access from different places, or if you want to 
collaborate with other people on a project.


Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because you don't know what's been added to the remote repository while you were doing something
else.  You would always want to first check the quality of the code before you pull it down.

Question: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead
of another?
Forks are used when you want to have your own copy of another person's remote repository as your own.  It's
a bit like doing a clone, except the clone is managed on a remote repository (aka "a remote").  Clones
are used to make a local copy of a repository on your local machine.  This has the advantage of allowing
you to work when there's not access to the remote.  Branches are used to isolate work on individual 
forks and features.
