 Having easy access to the entire history of the file makes you more efficient as a programmer
because it lets you quickly and efficiently determine previous states of the code, and in general
manage changes.

 The pros and cods of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, versus having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?  Being able to save when you choose, the manual
approach, allows for a more natural version control history.  Saving at regular time intervals could
produce crytpic messages.

 Version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, treat each file separately, because they are used for completely different purposes.

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 Use "git log" to list the history.  Use git diff with commit id numbers to get an comparison of the 
two files?

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you know that you could easily, accurately, and reliably revert to any previous version that worked,
or at least be able to easily track the history.  It allows you to be more of a risk-taker, without worrying
about breaking everything.  You can rethink the whole code base, and more easily explore.  Instead of concentrating
on making small steps, you can explore large changes.
